                <b>CARE – Community Action Respecting Elders</b> is volunteer-driven. Without our volunteers, CARE would not be able to provide services to seniors throughout Benton County and its surrounding areas. Volunteers are the heart of the CARE program and continue to impact the lives of the seniors they serve.
                </p>
                <p>
                As a CARE volunteer, you have the freedom to choose your schedule, set your hours, and volunteer as much as you feel able to give. There is no minimum time commitment.
                <br>
                <br>
                When filling out your application, you will have the opportunity to tell us where your time and talents are best suited, and when you will be available. When our scheduler calls you, it will be your decision whether to accept an assignment offered. Volunteering is on your time, and when you want to do it.
                <br>
                <br>
                Volunteers also have the opportunity to serve close to home or to allow for traveling beyond their home area. You will be able to state your preference when filling out your application. You may also make changes to your preferences at any time during your volunteer experience with CARE.
                <br>
                <br>
                As a nonprofit offering services to seniors, CARE is required to complete a screening process for their safety, which includes a standard background check. When volunteering as a driver, the process also includes a driver’s license check and a medical release from your physician.
                <br>
                <br>
                Short training sessions are provided annually to keep you updated on new State or Federal requirements, answer questions you may have, and inform you of new programs or changes to current programs. You are also encouraged to contact the office staff or Board members with any questions or concerns you may have throughout your time as a volunteer.
                </p>

                <h2>Voluntary Care Training</h2>
                <p>
                Since it is a skill, it can be improved with dedication. Voluntary care is widely recommended given the multiple applications that can be given to it, both in the educational field as well as in the work and social fields.
                <br>
                <br>
                The actions mentioned are neither dependent nor exclusive; each of them brings an improvement by itself. The more activity you train your brain, the better the results.
                </p>
               




               


                <h2>1. Physical care</h2>
               <p>
                In the foreground is the diet and general physical care. Keeping the body hydrated and with a balanced nutrient level sits the foundation on which the attention span will be sustained.
               </p>
               <h2>2. Conscious breathing</h2>
               <p>
                It is important to control breathing and body balance. Thus, the stability and oxygenation of the brain help when activating the mechanisms of perception.
               </p>
               <h2>3. Solve Abstract Exercises</h2>
               <p>
                It is possible to face exercises that enhance the capacity for abstraction and focus. With the resolution of mental problems of increasing difficulty, the brain can be given more tools to increase voluntary attention.
