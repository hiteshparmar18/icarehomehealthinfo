                <h2>SYMPTOMS NOT TO IGNORE: WHEN TO SEE A NEUROLOGIST</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Because they are often associated with a number of conditions, neurological symptoms can be easy to dismiss.
                    As they become more present or grow more severe, however, it is important to bring them to the attention of a doctor.
                    While they very well may be nothing, they can also be indicators of serious neurological conditions, such as a pituitary
                    tumor, which require the expertise of a skilled neurologist. With years of experience behind them, here are some of the
                    top symptoms the physicians of IGEA often seen patients overlook:<br>
                </p>
                <img src="images/neuro.jpg"><br>
                    
                <li>Headaches:</li>
                <p>There is no denying that headaches can be fairly common, sometimes a result of stress, fatigue, and hunger.
                    Pay attention to where the tension is located, how frequently they occur, and how much pain you're experiencing. 
                    If they become routine or start interfering with your life, discuss them with your doctor.
                </p>
               
                <li>Change in Vision:</li>    
                <p>Blurred, double, or loss of vision can result from the natural aging process, exposure to bright lights, or a surface
                    injury to the eye. However, they can also be a sign of a more severe neurological condition and should be assessed.
                </p>
               
                <li>Weakness of the Extremities:</li>
                <p>You may notice your arms or legs feeling heavy or numb after a workout but if these feelings occur for a prolonged period of time or
                    for an unknown reason, you should alert your doctor.
                </p>
                   
                <li>Dizziness:</li>
                <p>It's OK to feel a bit dizzy when you have a head cold or when standing up quickly after an afternoon at the office. What isn't
                    normal is chronic dizziness or that which comes out of nowhere. These could be signs of a number of different ailments and should be assessed.
                </p>

                <li>Sleep Problems:</li>
                <p>While everybody has the occasional restless night, insomnia and chronic fatigue are not normal. Address sleep problems early on to help identify 
                    a neurological condition before it progresses. A neurological specialist may recommend a sleep study to gain more insight.
                </p>

                <li>Slurred Speech: </li>
                <p>Some of the biggest causes of slurred speech are fatigue and being under the influence of alcohol or another substance. When slurred speech occurs 
                    outside of these reasons, there is usually an underlying issue that requires medical attention. Notify your doctor of this symptom so that he or she
                    may observe and run applicable tests.
                </p>
                            
                <li>Memory Loss:</li>
                <p>Mild forgetfulness is normal but when it starts to interfere with your everyday life or your friends and family pick up on it, it's time to bring it up to your doctor.
                    Memory loss is a symptom associated with a number of neurological conditions and a neurologist will be able to test and diagnose the underlying cause.
                </p>

                <li>Chronic Nausea:</li>
                <p> Nausea may be a symptom in and of itself, or it may occur as a result of other symptoms, such as migraines or dizziness. In either case, nausea that occurs chronically 
                    should be brought up to your physician.
                </p>

                <li>Tremors:</li>
                <p>Involuntary shaking can occur after an intense workout, in moments of fear or anxiety, or as a result of an allergic reaction. However, if the shaking occurs for a prolonged
                    period of time or if there are no indicators of why it is occurring, it may be a tremor and should be examined.
                </p>

                <li>Unexplained Weight Change:</li>
                <p>Many neurological conditions affect hormones, which can lead to abnormal weight gain or weight loss. If you notice your weight has fluctuated drastically for no known reason, it's
                    worth mentioning to your physician.
                </p>
                <br>
