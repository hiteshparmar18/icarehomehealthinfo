                <strong>Risk Factors:</strong><br>
                While doctors have an idea of what may increase your risk of cancer, the majority of cancers occur in people who don't have any known risk factors. 
                Factors known to increase your risk of cancer include:
                </p>

                <p>
                <strong>Your Age</strong><br>
                Cancer can take decades to develop. That's why most people diagnosed with cancer are 65 or older. While it's more common in older adults, cancer isn't
                exclusively an adult disease — cancer can be diagnosed at any age.
                </p>

                <p>
                <strong>Your Habits</strong><br>
                Certain lifestyle choices are known to increase your risk of cancer. Smoking, drinking more than one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men, 
                excessive exposure to the sun or frequent blistering sunburns, being obese, and having unsafe sex can contribute to cancer.
                <br>
                You can change these habits to lower your risk of cancer — though some habits are easier to change than others.
                </p>

                <p>
                <strong>Your Health conditions</strong><br>
                Some chronic health conditions, such as ulcerative colitis, can markedly increase your risk of developing certain cancers. Talk to your doctor about your risk.
                </p>

                <p>
                <strong>Your Environmen</strong><br>
                The environment around you may contain harmful chemicals that can increase your risk of cancer. Even if you don't smoke, you might inhale secondhand smoke
                if you go where people are smoking or if you live with someone who smokes. Chemicals in your home or workplace, such as asbestos and benzene, also are associated with an increased risk of cancer.
                </p>

                <h2>Cancer Care Prevention:</h2>
                <p>
                <strong>Doctors have identified several ways to reduce your risk of cancer, such as:</strong><br>
                </p>

                <img src="">

                <p>
                <li><strong> Stop Smoking:</strong> <br>
                If you smoke, quit. If you don't smoke, don't start. Smoking is linked to several types of cancer — not just lung cancer. Stopping now will reduce your risk of cancer in the future.
                </li> </p>

                <p>
                <li><strong>Avoid excessive sun exposure:</strong></li>
                Harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun can increase your risk of skin cancer. Limit your sun exposure by staying in the shade, wearing protective clothing or applying sunscreen.
                </p>

                <p>
                <li><strong>Eat a healthy diet:</strong></li>
                Choose a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Select whole grains and lean proteins. Limit your intake of processed meats.
                </p>

                <p>
                <li><strong>Exercise most days of the week:</strong></li>
                Regular exercise is linked to a lower risk of cancer. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week. If you haven't been exercising regularly, start out slowly and work your way up to 30 minutes or longer.
                </p>

                <p>
                <li><strong>Maintain a healthy weight:</strong></li>
                Being overweight or obese may increase your risk of cancer. Work to achieve and maintain a healthy weight through a combination of a healthy diet and regular exercise.
                </p>

                <p>
                <li><strong>Drink alcohol in moderation, if you choose to drink:</strong></li>
                If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.    
                </p>

                <p>
                <li><strong>Schedule cancer screening exams:</strong></li>
                Talk to your doctor about what types of cancer screening exams are best for you based on your risk factors.
                </p>

                <p>
                <li><strong>Ask your doctor about immunizations:</strong></li>
                Certain viruses increase your risk of cancer. Immunizations may help prevent those viruses, including hepatitis B, which increases the risk of liver cancer, and human papillomavirus (HPV), which increases the risk of cervical cancer and other cancers. Ask your doctor whether immunization against these viruses is appropriate for you.
