          <h2>We are provide all the information about home health care</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>
            Homecare (also spelled as home care) is health care or supportive care 
            provided by a professional caregiver in the individual home where the
            patient or client is living, as opposed to care provided in group accommodations
            like clinics or nursing homes.Homecare is also known as domiciliary care, social
            care or in-home care.It comprises a range of activities, especially paramedical aid
            by nurses and assistance in daily living for ill, disabled or elderly people.
            Home health nurses may assist patients with activities of daily living (ADLs) such as 
            bathing, toileting, and feeding, or they direct and supervise the aide in providing ADL
            care.Nurses keep track of vital signs, carry out physician orders, draw blood, document
            the tasks they perform and the patient's health status, and communicate between the patient, 
            family, and physician.
          </p>

          <h2>Why HomeCare?</h2>
          <p>
            Home Care as a concept is gaining ground in India. The growth drivers are the changing clinical and societal milieu.
            Some estimates point out current geriatric population (aged over 60 years) - at over 100 million. This expected to 
            grow to 325 million by 2050.
          </p>

          <p>
            In India, Home Healthcare is at a very nascent stage as compared to western countries.80% of non-urgent medical care
            that is currently given in hospital can be delivered at home, some of which are:
          </p>

          <strong>Continuum of Care:</strong>
         <p> 
          The need for better equality post-operative and primary care beyond hospitas in order to improve
          long-term outcomes post procedure.Non-communication diseases which are chronic in nature, requiring long-term
          monitoring and regular intervention to keep them on track.
          </p>

          <strong>Family Structure:</strong>
          <p>
            With the growing number of nuclear families, with grearter urban and even international migration, the elderly are left with on caregivers.
          </p>

          <strong>Quality of Life:</strong>
          <p>
            People are now looking not just at longevity, but also the quality of life. Apart from complex medical procedures, if these don't siginfication improve
            , quality of life would a small attitude among the elite. Rather than seek aggressive medical intervention, ,many are opting management at home.
          </p>

          <strong>Mindset:</strong>
          <p>
            A changing consumer mindset is now trending toward companing Healthcare with other services, with access to healthcare at the place and time of their convenience.
          <br>
            Homecare or home based healthcare is thus a solution is increasingly better suited for the times we live in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, elderly care, physiotherapy, rehabilitation and diabetes management are four services that witness
            maximum demand in the homecare segement. Going forward, we foresee a growing demand for dialysis, chemotherapy, caring
            for children with special needs and pallative care.
          </p>
          <p>
            At macro level too, home healthcarefrees up precious hospital beds and comes as a boon for the already burdened healthcareinfrastructure in India.
          </p>
          <p>
            The siginfication demand-supply gap in our healthcare system is addressed as homecare complements the overall healthcare delivery system by reducing the 
            average length of stay in a hospital, ensuring proper utilization of existing bed capacity and siginficantly strengthening the care continum.
          </p>
