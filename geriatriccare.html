                <h2>Geriatric Diseases</h2>
                <p>Geriatric medicine specializes in treating the conditions commonly experienced by older adults. There are numerous variables that make treating
                    older adults different from their younger counterparts, including polypharmacy, vague presentation of symptoms, and challenges with attribution
                    in cases where multiple health conditions are present at once.<br>
                    Older adults are also more prone to developing age related diseases that younger people do not typically develop. High blood pressure might be an 
                    intergenerational problem, but issues like cardiovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, urinary incontinence, vascular dementia, multiple sclerosis,
                    and other diseases are far more common among older adults.
                </p>

                     <h2>Chronic Disease</h2>
                     <p>While this is by no means a comprehensive list of ailments experienced by older adults, these and other chronic diseases are among the more common:<br>
                        <li>Arthritis</li>
                        <li>Cancer</li>
                        <li>Chronic Kidney Disease</li>
                        <li>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</li>
                        <li>Dementia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's</li>
                        <li>Diabetes</li>
                        <li>Osteoporosis</li>
                        <li>Stroke</li>
                    </p>
                 <strong>Arthritis</strong>
                    <p>This chronic disease is one of the most common age related conditions older adults experience. Arthritis causes joint pain and chronic inflammation.
                        The two types are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis, the more common of the two, is a result of normal wear and tear.
                        Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the lining of the joints.
                        <br>
                        There is no cure for arthritis, but it can be managed with painkillers and corticosteroids. Symptoms include:<br>
                        <li>Pain, stiffness, and tenderness of the joints</li>
                        <li>Inflammation around joints</li>
                        <li>Limited or restricted movement</li>
                    </p>
                    <strong>Cancer</strong>
                    <p>With over 200 different forms of cancer — prostate cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer just to name a few — this is one of the most common issues that
                       older people face. Cancer occurs through the rapid and abnormal replication of cells in the body, forming tumors than can spread via the bloodstream.
                       <br>
                       While cures have been discovered for many types of cancer, cancer treatment can be extremely invasive and takes a major toll on the body. However, the earlier
                       it is detected, the better the chance of beating it. It is a good idea to consider conducting a periodic cancer screening. Here are the common symptoms:<br>
                      <li>Discovery of an unexpected lump or mass</li>
                      <li>Inexplicable weight loss</li>
                       <li>Blood in a person's stool, urine, vomit, or when coughing</li>
                       </p>
                   
                    <strong>Chronic Kidney Disease</strong>
                    <p>Kidney infections, kidney inflammation, high blood pressure, and diabetes can all lead to chronic kidney disease. This condition affects the kidneys and can lead 
                       to kidney failure, and there is presently no cure. Another unfortunate reality is that early symptoms do not commonly appear — instead, the condition is usually
                       identified through urine tests ordered for other medical conditions.
                       <br>
                       Older adults must therefore be diligent in reporting the following later-stage symptoms to their doctor as soon as they discover them:<br>
                       <li>Bloody Urine</li>
                       <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                       <li>Swollen ankles, hands, or feet</li>
                       <li>Tiredness or a feeling of sickness</li>
                    </p>
                    
                    <strong>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</strong>
                    <p>The best known condition under this category of illness is chronic bronchitis. Bronchitis is caused by an infection affecting the lungs and airways, contributing to a buildup of excessive mucus. The body tries to displace this buildup through coughing.
                        <br>
                        Smoking is one of the biggest contributing factors to the development of chronic bronchitis, which means that quitting is the best way to overcome it. A healthy diet is also important — as are rest, hydration, and the treatment of headaches.
                        <br>
                        Symptoms of bronchitis include:
                        <li>Chest pain</li>
                        <li>Fatigue</li>
                        <li>Hacking, productive cough</li>
                        <li>Headaches</li>
                        <li>Runny nose or congestion</li>
                        <li>Sore Throat</li>
                    </p>
                   
                    <strong>Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, and Parkinson's Disease</strong>
                    <p>
                        Dementia is an umbrella term used to describe a syndrome — or a collection of chronic conditions — in older adults that lead to problems with memory and cognition. This occurs when there is damage to brain cells or a loss of connection between cells that causes them to die. Symptoms of dementia include:
                        <br>
                       <li> Memory loss</li>
                       <li>Difficulty with verbal expression</li>
                       <li>Struggles with visual or spatial abilities</li>
                       <li>Trouble with problem-solving or reasoning</li>
                       <li>Difficulty managing complex tasks, critical thinking skills, planning, and organization</li>
                       <li>Decline in coordination with motor functions</li>
                       <li>Confusion and disorientation</li>
                       <li>Personality changes</li>
                       <li>Inappropriate behavior</li>
                       <li>Depression, anxiety, paranoia, and agitation</li>
                       <li>Hallucinations</li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alzheimer's disease is a specific type of dementia, accounting for up to 70% of cases. Caused by disruptive buildups of proteins in the brain, the symptoms of Alzheimer's include:
                        <br>
                        <li>Trouble remembering details about people, places, or events</li>
                        <li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
                        <li>Changes to one's personality like Disinterest, Suspicion, or Aggression</li>
                        <li>Apathy and depression</li>
                        <li>Mood Changes</li>
                        <li>Confusion</li>
                        <li>Impaired judgement or decision-making abilities</li>
                        <li>Difficulty with speaking, swallowing, or walking</li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Parkinson's disease is another type of dementia. This progressive disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in the brain, which reduces the amount of dopamine necessary for normal cognitive functioning. While there is no cure, the symptoms can be treated. Here is what to look out for:
                        <br>
                        <li>Involuntary shaking of particular parts of the body</li>
                        <li>Muscles that are Stiff and Inflexible</li>
                        <li>Slow Movement</li>
                    </p>
                            
                    <strong>Diabetes</strong>
                    <p>
                        Diabetes can develop during middle age — and sometimes even younger. But it most commonly develops among older adults, and it has to be managed as a lifelong condition. This disease occurs when the body is not able to produce enough insulin to ensure normal functioning.
                        <br>
                        The most common type of diabetes is Type II diabetes. This is when the pancreas is no longer capable of producing the appropriate amount of insulin. A person's chance of developing diabetes can be reduced through lifestyle changes, including:<br>
                       <li> A healthy Diet</li>
                       <li>A healthy weight</li>
                       <li>Regular Exercise</li>
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                       Type I diabetes accounts for about 10% of overall cases. It is an autoimmune disease, in which the body attacks the cells that produce insulin.
                    </p>
                    
                    <strong>Osteoporosis</strong>
                    <p>
                        Osteoporosis is one of the most common conditions among older adults. This condition presents as a reduction in bone density, and it often goes undetected until a fall causes a break or fracture. Like losing muscle mass, losing bone strength is part of the normal aging process, but people with osteoporosis experience this decline more quickly than most people.
                        <br>
                        Osteoporosis can be treated with medication and supplements like calcium and vitamin D. Weight-bearing exercises and exercises designed to increase muscle strength can also help older adults manage the condition.
                    </p>

                    <strong>Stroke</strong>
                    <p>
                        A stroke occurs when the brain's vital blood flow is cut off. This causes brain cells to die, it can lead to permanent disability, and it can be life threatening. Strokes are very common among older adults, so it is important to know the signs and symptoms so you can seek medical attention as soon as possible. A helpful acronym (FAST) makes it easier to remember.
                        <br>
                        <li>Face: Is the face drooping on one side</li>
                        <li>Arms: Is the person unable to lift both arms</li>
                        <li>Speech: Is their speech slurred</li>
                        <li>Time: If so, do not waste time — seek medical attention immediately.</li>

                    <h2>Geriatric Care Prevention:</h2>
                    <strong>The Discipline: What Is Geriatrics and What Does a Geriatrician Do?</strong>
                    <p>
                        Geriatric medicine is a type of practice within internal medicine that focuses on the care of older patients. Those who practice geriatric medicine (“geriatricians”) are specifically trained in the normal and abnormal physiologic and psychosocial changes associated with aging, and to recognize the differences in presentation of disease relative to normal aging. Geriatricians also recognize the importance of maintaining functional independence in older patients and focus on providing preventive interventions.
                        <br>
                        Most geriatricians are primary care physicians who desire additional training and skills focused on an older patient population. The clinical settings in which geriatric medicine is practiced are quite varied. Many geriatricians continue in primary care practice, and geriatrics training uniquely equips clinicians for work in rehabilitation, extended care, and home health settings. Geriatricians may also provide consultative services to other physicians or health care institutions.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Geriatrics Training</strong>
                    <p>
                        Geriatric fellowship training requires one year of training beyond general internal medicine residency, which prepares them for board certification in geriatrics.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Training Positions</strong>
                    <p>
                        In the 2021-2022 academic year, there were 114 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited training programs in geriatric medicine (internal medicine) with 303 trainees.
