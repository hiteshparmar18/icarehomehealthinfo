                Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) are the only health care professionals whose primary qualification is in rehabilitation.
                <br>
                <br> 
                Specialist Palliative Care (SPC) AHPs are involved in the care of individuals with complex and unresolved needs. They are recognised as essential members of all 
                specialist palliative care teams and their core activity is limited to the provision of specialist palliative care.
                <br>
                <br>
                Their job plan includes the four key elements of the specialist practitioner role:
                </p>
                <p>
                • Expert clinical practice<br>
                • Provision of formal and informal education<br>
                • Research audit and development of best practice guidelines<br>
                • Service improvement and leadership.
                </p>
                <p>
                Specialist Palliative Care AHPs require a greater degree of training and expert 
                knowledge. They will have undergone or be working towards a recognised post 
                graduate qualification in palliative care.
                </p>
